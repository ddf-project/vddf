# Visual DDF

When talking about Data Visualizations, most people think of charts, graphs and perhaps some interactivity. 
Visual DDF is a framework that considers visualizations as first-class objects that also act as data sources and sinks.
This enables powerful collaboration where thousands of users can build on the work of one another through the sharing of visualization objects.
