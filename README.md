## Visual DDF ##

When talking about Data Visualizations, most people think of charts, graphs and perhaps some interactivity. 
Visual DDF (vDDF) is a framework that considers visualizations as first-class objects that also act as data sources and sinks.
This enables powerful collaboration where thousands of users can build on the work of one another through the sharing of visualization objects.

This repository includes the vDDF core and vDDF react. We are publishing data extractor extension and server soon!

### How to build vDDF ###

  * Use `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
  * Run `npm run build` to build `vddf.js`.

After that open `examples/index.html` to interact with your first vDDF
